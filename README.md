# Tammy's Gallery/Personal Website

### [View the site](https://tspeed90.github.io)

My personal website features a photography gallery and a little bit about my interests and experiences as a developer. It is largely a page used for me to practice front end web development and try out new things. The page also includes my CV, a Guess The Number game I made early on and hopefully soon, more examples of projects I've worked on.

Basically, it is a work in progress :smiley:
